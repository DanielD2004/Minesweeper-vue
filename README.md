# Minesweeper-vue

This is a remake of my minesweeper project that I made in python using vue. It uses recursion to sweep around a tile if you click on a tile that has no nearby bombs. You can select a difficulty and the board will change accordingly

To run this on your own system, download the files and place them into a directory. In your terminal, navigate to this directory using cd ... then run npm install. Next run npm run dev, and your local host should be created.
