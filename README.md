# Minesweeper-vue

This is a remake of my minesweeper project that I made in python using vue. It uses recursion to sweep around a tile if you click on a one that has no nearby bombs. You can select a difficulty and the board will change accordingly

I chose to make the win condition flagging all the bombs, in hindsight I'm not sure why, as digging all the bombs would have been more typical
